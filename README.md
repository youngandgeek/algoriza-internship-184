Project Update:

The primary area that has posed a significant challenge for me is the understanding and implementation of Dependency Injection, Identity, and Onion Architecture. I have been investing considerable time to grasp these concepts thoroughly, and unfortunately, it has taken longer than anticipated.

Specifically, I have been facing difficulties in understanding and implementing the Identity framework. Despite dedicating substantial effort over the past two weeks, I have not been able to achieve the level of understanding I aimed for. I have tried to progress without incorporating Identity and user registration, but it resulted in a futile use of time.

To demonstrate my commitment and efforts, I have attached a demo showcasing the topics I have been diligently studying. It is important to note that I have been cautious about not merely copying code without a deeper comprehension, as I believe in truly understanding the principles before implementation.
